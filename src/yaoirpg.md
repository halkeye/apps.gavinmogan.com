A silly little web based game myself and a couple other students made for one of our BCIT classes. The ask was to make a website.

It was codenamed YAOI RPG, mostly for the giggles, because few knew what yaoi was. Officially it stood for:

> Yet Another Online Interaction Role Playing Game

The teacher was really impressed as most people just made generated e-commerace sites using tools provided. Teach proclaimed how much he loved yaoi now.
